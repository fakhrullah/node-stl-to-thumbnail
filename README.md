# node-stl-to-thumbnail

Create thumbnail from 3D STL file. Creates beautifully rendered png and jpeg output server-side with no GPU from ASCII and Binary STL's.

> This code is forked from [`node-stl-thumbnailer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-stl-thumbnailer) by instructables but I cannot found it in Github anymore.

## Installation
```npm install --save node-stl-to-thumbnail```

## Usage

The following snippet loads a file from the current directory (```./input.stl```), and creates a 500x500 png thumbnail in the current directory called ```./output.png```.

```javascript
var StlThumbnailer = require('node-stl-to-thumbnail');
var fs = require('fs');

var thumbnailer = new StlThumbnailer({
	filePath: __dirname + "/input.stl",
	requestThumbnails: [
		{
			width: 500,
			height: 500
		}
	] 	
})
.then(function(thumbnails){
	// thumbnails is an array (in matching order to your requests) of Canvas objects
	// you can write them to disk, return them to web users, etc
	// see node-canvas documentation at https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas
	thumbnails[0].toBuffer(function(err, buf){      
		fs.writeFileSync(__dirname + "/output.png", buf);
    })
})
```

## Help needed

To be honest, I am not fully understand this. Need help on:

1. Camera setting, so that can get view from any perspective I want
2. Render setting so that it look beautiful. If you see Three.js website the 3D item are so beautiful
3. Update to use latest JavaScript ( ES2015++ )
